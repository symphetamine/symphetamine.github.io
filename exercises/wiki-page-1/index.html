            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement,<sup>[1]</sup>
            canopy shyness, <sup>[2]</sup> or inter-crown spacing<sup>[3]</sup></i>)
            is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not
            touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup>
            The phenomenon is most prevalent amount trees of the same species, but also 
            occurs between trees of different species. <sup>[6][7]</sup> There exist many hypotheses
            as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit
            spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.<sup>[6]</sup> 
            It has been discussed in scientific literature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> 
            The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might suggest that there are 
            multiple mechanisms across different species, an example of convergent 
            evolution.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches leads to 
            "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees. Trees in windy areas suffer physical 
            damage as they collide with each other during winds. The abrasions and collisions 
            induce a crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is 
            largely uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.<sup>[10]</sup>
            If the crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, they gradually 
            fill the canopy gaps.<sup>[11]</sup> This explains instances of crown shyness between branches 
            of the same organism. Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen
            in conditions conducive to this pruning, including windy forests, stands of flexible
            trees, and early succession forests where branches are flexible and limited in
            lateral movement.<sup>[6][12]</sup>According to this theory, variable flexibility in lateral
            branches greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.

        <h1>Resentment</h1>
        <h6>From Wikiepedia, the free encyclopedia</h6>

             <i>Not to be confused with ressentiment.</i>
             <br>
             <i>This article is about the emotion. For other uses, see Resentment (disambiguation).</i>
         </p>
         <p>
            <b>Resentment</b> (also called <b>ranklement</b> or <b>bitterness</b>)
            is a complex, multilayered emotion <sup>[1]</sup> that has been described 
            as a mixture of disappointment, disgust, and anger. <sup>[2]</sup> Other 
            psychologists consider it a mood<sup>[3]</sup> or as a secondary emotion
            (including cognitive elements) that can be elicited in the face of 
            insult and/or injury.<sup>[4]</sup>
         </p>
         <p>
            Inherent in resentment is a perception of unfairness (i.e. from trivial 
            to very serious), and a generalized defense against unfair situations 
            (e.g. relationships or unfavourable circumstances).<sup>[3]</sup>
         </p>
         <p>
            The word originates from French <i>"ressentir"</i>, re-, intensive prefix, 
            and <i>sentir</i> "to feel"; from the Latin "sentire". The English word has
            become synonymous with anger, spite, and holding a grudge.

         <h3>Causes</h3>

            Resentment can result from a variety of situations involving a perceived 
            wrongdoing from an individual, which are often sparked by expressions of 
            injustice or humiliation. Common sources of resentment include publicly 
            humiliating incidents such as accepting negative treatment without voicing 
            any protest; feeling like an object of regular discrimination or prejudice; 
            envy/jealousy; feeling used or taken advantage of by others; and having achievements
            go unrecognized, while others succeed without working as hard. Resentment can 
            also be generated by dyadic interactions, such as emotional rejection or denial 
            by another person, deliberate embarrassment or belittling by another person, 
            or ignorance, putting down, or scorn by another person.<sup>[5]</sup>
         </p>
         <p>
            Resentment can also develop, and be maintained by: focusing on past grievances 
            (i.e. disturbing memories of hurtful experiences) continuously,<sup>[3]</sup> or by trying
             to justify the emotion (i.e. with additional thoughts/feelings).<sup>[6][7]</sup> Thus, 
             resentment can occur as a result of the grief process<sup>[8]</sup> and can be sustained
             by ruminating.<sup>[9]</sup>
