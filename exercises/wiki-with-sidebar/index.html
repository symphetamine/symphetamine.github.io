                    Regina Ilyinichna Spektor (Russian: Регинa Ильинична 
                    Спектор, pronounced [rʲɪˈɡʲinə ˈspʲɛktər]; born February 
                    18, 1980)[1] is a Russian–born American singer, 
                    songwriter, and pianist.[2] After self-releasing her 
                    first three records and gaining popularity in New York 
                    City's independent music scenes, particularly the 
                    anti-folk scene centered on New York City's East Village, 
                    Spektor signed with Sire Records in 2004 resulting in 
                    greater mainstream recognition.[3] After giving her 
                    third album a major label re-release, Sire released 
                    Spektor's fourth album, Begin to Hope, which achieved a 
                    Gold certification by the RIAA.[4] Her following two 
                    albums, Far and What We Saw from the Cheap Seats, each 
                    debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200. Mayor Bill de 
                    Blasio proclaimed June 11, 2019, Regina Spektor Day in
                    New York City.[5] Spektor was also inducted into the 
                    Bronx Walk of Fame on May 18, 2019, by Borough President 
                    Rubén Díaz Jr.[6]

                <h3>Early life and musical beginnings </h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Spektor was born in 1980 in Moscow, Soviet Union, to a 
                    musical Russian-Jewish family.[7][8][9][10] Her father, 
                    Ilya Spektor, was a photographer and amateur violinist. 
                    Her mother, Bella Spektor, was a music professor in a 
                    Soviet college of music and taught at public elementary 
                    schools in Mount Vernon, New York, now retired.[11] 
                    Spektor has a brother, Boruch (also known as Bear), who 
                    was featured in track 7, "* * *", or "Whisper", of her 
                    2004 album Soviet Kitsch. Growing up in Moscow, Regina 
                    started taking piano lessons when she was seven and 
                    learned how to play the piano by practicing on a Petrof 
                    upright that her grandfather gave her mother.[12][13] 
                    She grew up listening to classical music and Russian 
                    bards like Vladimir Vysotsky and Bulat Okudzhava.[2] 
                    Her father, who obtained recordings in Eastern Europe 
                    and traded cassettes with friends in the Soviet Union, 
                    also exposed her to rock and roll bands such as the 
                    Beatles, Queen, and the Moody Blues.[11]
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The family left the Soviet Union for the Bronx in 1989, 
                    when Spektor was nine and a half, during the period of 
                    Perestroika, when Soviet citizens were permitted to 
                    emigrate. She had to leave her piano behind.[14] The 
                    seriousness of her piano studies led her parents to 
                    consider not leaving the Soviet Union, but they finally 
                    decided to emigrate due to the racial, ethnic, and 
                    political discrimination that Jewish people faced.
                    [15][16][17] Traveling first to Austria and then Italy, 
                    the Spektor family was admitted to the United States as 
                    refugees with the assistance of HIAS (the Hebrew 
                    Immigrant Aid Society). They settled in the Bronx, where 
                    Spektor graduated from SAR Academy, a Jewish day middle 
                    school in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. Since the 
                    family had been unable to bring their piano from Moscow, 
                    Spektor practiced on tabletops and other hard surfaces 
                    until she found a piano to play in the basement of her 
                    synagogue. In New York City, Spektor studied classical 
                    piano with Sonia Vargas, a professor at the Manhattan 
                    School of Music, until she was 17; Spektor's father had 
                    met Vargas through Vargas' husband, violinist Samuel 
                    Marder.[18] Spektor attended high school for two years at 
                    the Frisch School, a yeshiva in Paramus, New Jersey, but 
                    transferred to a public school, Fair Lawn High School,[19] 
                    in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, where she finished the last two 
                    years of her high school education.[20]

                    <br>
                    Spektor was originally interested in classical music only, 
                    but she later grew interested in hip hop, rock, and punk 
                    as well.[11] Although she had always made up songs around 
                    the house, she first became interested in more formal 
                    songwriting during a visit to Israel with the Nesiya 
                    Institute in her teenage years when she attracted 
                    attention from the other children on the trip for the 
                    songs she made up while hiking.[17]
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Following this trip, Spektor was exposed to the works of 
                    Joni Mitchell, Ani DiFranco, and other singer-songwriters, 
                    which encouraged her belief that she could create her own 
                    songs.[17] She wrote her first a cappella songs around the 
                    age of 16 and her first songs for voice and piano when she 
                    was 17.[11]

                    <br>
                    Spektor completed the four-year studio composition program 
                    of the Conservatory of Music at Purchase College within 
                    three years, graduating with honors in 2001. Around this 
                    time, she also worked briefly at a butterfly farm in Luck, 
                    Wisconsin,[21][22] and studied in Tottenham (in North 
                    London) for one term.[23]

                    <h4>2001–2005: Career beginnings and <i>Soviet Kitsch</i></h4>
                    Spektor gradually achieved recognition through performances 
                    in the anti-folk scene in downtown New York City, most 
                    prominently at the East Village's SideWalk Cafe. She also 
                    performed at local colleges (such as Sarah Lawrence 
                    College) with other musicians, including the Trachtenburg 
                    Family Slideshow Players. She sold self-published CDs at 
                    her performances during this period: 11:11 (2001) and 
                    Songs (2002). Spektor's first nationwide tour was 
                    accompanying The Strokes as the opening act on their 
                    2003–2004 Room on Fire tour which included performances 
                    at The Theater at Madison Square Garden. While on the 
                    tour, she and the band performed and recorded "Modern 
                    Girls & Old Fashion Men". After the tour, Kings of Leon, 
                    who were the second opening act on the tour, invited 
                    Spektor to open for them on their own European tour. In 
                    2004, Spektor signed a contract with Warner Brothers' 
                    record label Sire Records to publish and distribute her 
                    third album Soviet Kitsch, originally self-released in 
                    2003. In 2005, she began making her first TV appearances 
                    including guest spots on various late-night talk shows.[3]

                    In June 2005, Spektor was the opening act for the 
                    English piano rock band Keane on their North American 
                    tour, during which she performed at Radio City Music 
                    Hall on June 7, 2005.[24]

                    <h4>2006–2008: <i>Begin to Hope</i></h4>
                    Spektor went on to release the album Begin to Hope on 
                    June 13, 2006. The album debuted at number 70 on the 
                    Billboard 200, but due to the popularity of the single 
                    "Fidelity", it went on to peak at number 20, and was 
                    certified Gold by the RIAA. Spektor received increased 
                    attention when her video for "Fidelity" was viewed over 
                    200,000 times in two days on YouTube. Spektor's 2006 
                    headlining tour in support of the Begin to Hope album 
                    included back-to-back hometown shows at Town Hall Theater 
                    in New York City on September 27 and September 28, 
                    2006.[25] This tour was Spektor's first to feature a 
                    full backing band.

                    Listeners of Sirius Radio's Left of Center channel voted 
                    her single "Fidelity" as the No. 1 song of 2006. Towards 
                    the end of 2006, VH1 showcased her as part of its 
                    "You Oughta Know: Artists on the Rise" featurettes, 
                    playing clips from the "Fidelity" music video and 
                    showing parts of an interview with Spektor during 
                    commercial breaks on the channel.[26] Spektor's video 
                    for "Fidelity" reached No. 3 on VH1's Top 20 Countdown.
                    [citation needed] Spektor reached No. 33 on Blender 
                    magazine's top 100 of 2006 and was also listed as one of 
                    the "Hottest Women of Rock".[27] On January 21, 2007, she 
                    was given an extensive feature on CBS News Sunday Morning 
                    which showcased her musical beginnings and growing 
                    popularity.[28]

                    In 2007, Spektor began performing at several major music 
                    festivals including Coachella Valley Music and Arts 
                    Festival, Bonnaroo Music Festival, Lollapalooza, Virgin 
                    Festival, and Austin City Limits Music Festival. On

                    VH1 and YouTube, where it received more than 100,000 views 
                    within the first 24 hours. Spektor performed acoustic at

                    On November 14, 2007, at her concert at Ryman Auditorium 
                    in Nashville, Spektor collapsed during the sound check 
                    and was taken to a local emergency room. According to the 
                    statement given to the audience, Spektor was fine, but 
                    doctors said that she could not perform that night. It 
                    was later reported that the cause of the collapse was an 
                    inner ear infection which caused intense vertigo. The 
                    show was initially rescheduled for December 6, 2007,[29] 
                    but the date was once again rescheduled, and the concert 
                    finally occurred on February 29, 2008.[30] After her 
                    initial collapse in Nashville, she was able to perform in 
                    concerts at Mountain Stage, in West Virginia, on 
                    November 18, 2007 (the concert was aired in 
                    September 2008),[31][32] and at Duke University on 
                    November 19, 2007.[33]

                    Spektor wrote the song "The Call" for the 2008 film 
                    The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,[34] which 
                    appeared prominently in the film's finale sequence. 
                    She then appeared as a guest vocalist on "You Don't 
                    Know Me", a single from Ben Folds' 2008 album, Way to 
                    Normal. In promotion for the single, the duo performed 
                    the song together on several late-night talk shows.

                    <h4>2009–2011: <i>Far</i></h4>
                    Spektor's fifth album, Far, was released June 23, 2009. 
                    For the record she worked with four producers: David 
                    Kahne (who had previously worked with Spektor on Begin 
                    to Hope), Mike Elizondo, Jacknife Lee, and Jeff Lynne. 
                    The record sold 50,000 copies in its first week, entering 
                    the US Billboard 200 at number three; the record remained 
                    on the chart for 19 weeks. The album peaked at number 30 
                    and 16 in the UK and Canada, respectively. She then 
                    headlined at Serpentine Sessions, a series of concerts 
                    at London's Hyde Park on June 29, 2009. Other European 
                    performances in 2009 included Glastonbury Festival, 
                    Hultsfred Festival, Oxegen 2009, T in the Park, Paradiso, 
                    Latitude Festival, and Rock Werchter. Spektor invited 
                    Brooklyn-based rock band Jupiter One to open concerts on 
                    her 2009 North American tour. As a part of that tour, on 
                    October 14, 2009, Spektor headlined a concert at Radio 
                    City Music Hall in NYC. On September 16, 2009, it was 
                    announced that Spektor would write the music for the 
                    musical Beauty, a modern adaptation of the fairy tale 
                    Sleeping Beauty, which was initially set to open during 
                    the 2011–12 Broadway season.[35] Regina made her 
                    Saturday Night Live debut on October 10, 2009, performing 
                    "Eet" and "The Calculation" off of Far.

                    In May 2010, Spektor performed for Barack and Michelle 
                    Obama along with hundreds of other guests at the White 
                    House reception in honor of Jewish American Heritage Month. 
                    She performed "Us" and "The Sword & The Pen."

                    Spektor's sixth album, What We Saw from the Cheap Seats, 
                    was released May 29, 2012. Like her previous album, it 
                    debuted at number three on the Billboard 200. Promotional 
                    appearances for the record included Spektor appearing on 
                    the June 7, 2012 episode of The Colbert Report where she 
                    performed "Small Town Moon" as well as "Ballad of a 
                    Politician" as online bonus content.[36][37][38] Her world 
                    tour in support of What We Saw from the Cheap Seats 
                    included a performance in Moscow; Spektor had not returned 
                    since leaving with her family in 1989.[39]

                    In 2012, Spektor was named an official "Steinway Artist"; 
                    she plays Steinway & Sons pianos almost exclusively.[40]

                    Spektor wrote and recorded the main title theme song, 
                    "You've Got Time", for the Netflix original series
                    Orange Is the New Black,[41] which premiered in July 2013. 
                    It was nominated in the Best Song Written for Visual Media 
                    category at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards.[42]

                    Spektor announced her seventh album, Remember Us to Life 
                    on July 21, 2016, through her email newsletter. The album 
                    was released on September 30, 2016.[43] The first single, 
                    "Bleeding Heart", was released July 22, 2016. The follow-up 
                    single, "Small Bill$", was released August 11, 2016. 
                    Regina Spektor performed George Harrison's "While My 
                    Guitar Gently Weeps", released August 5, 2016, for the 
                    film Kubo and the Two Strings.[44]

                    In 2017, Spektor was featured as a guest singer on the 
                    title track to Gypsy-punk band Gogol Bordello's studio 
                    album Seekers and Finders.[46] Spektor was also featured 
                    as a guest vocalist on Odesza's song "Just A Memory" from 
                    their album A Moment Apart.

                    her own song "You've Got Time", coinciding with the release 
                    of the seventh and final season of Orange Is the New Black.

                    <h4>2022–Present: <i>Home, Before and After</i></h4>
                    On February 22, 2022, Spektor announced her eighth studio 
                    album Home, Before and After with a June 24 release date, 
                    alongside the release of the album's lead single "Becoming 
                    All Alone". Recorded in upstate New York, the album was 
                    produced by Spektor and John Congleton.[49]
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She performed an NPR Tiny Desk Concert on 5 August 2022, 
                    including "Becoming All Alone" from her new album as well 
                    as tunes from past releases such as "Fidelity" and 
                    "Samson".[50]
                </p>
                <h3>Voice and style</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Spektor's primary instrument is the piano, and she plays 
                    the guitar as a secondary instrument, primarily playing on 
                    a seafoam Epiphone Wildkat archtop hollow-body electric 
                    guitar for live performances.[51] Spektor has said that 
                    she has created a great number of songs[52] but rarely 
                    writes any of them down. Spektor's songs are not usually 
                    autobiographical but are based on scenarios and characters 
                    drawn from her imagination.[17][53] Her songs show 
                    influences from folk,[54][55] punk, rock, Jewish,[53][56]
                    Russian,[53] hip hop,[54][57] jazz,[54] and classical 
                    music.[53] Spektor has said that she works hard to ensure 
                    that each of her songs has its own musical style, rather 
                    than trying to develop a distinctive style for her music 
                    as a whole:[28] "It doesn't feel natural for me to write 
                    some diary type song. I want to write a classic like 
                    "Yesterday" but weird songs about meatballs in 
                    refrigerators come into my head – I can't help it."[58]
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Spektor performs using a broad vocal range, with a 
                    falsetto extension, but without any apparent break. 
                    She explores a variety of different and somewhat 
                    unorthodox vocal techniques, such as verses composed 
                    entirely of buzzing noises made with the lips and 
                    beatbox-style flourishes in the middle of ballads, 
                    and also makes use of such unusual musical techniques 
                    as using a drum stick to tap rhythms on the body of a 
                    chair.[17][59] Part of her style also results from the 
                    exaggeration of certain aspects of vocalization, most 
                    notably the glottal stop, prominent in the single 
                    "Fidelity". She also uses a strong New York accent on 
                    some words, which she has said is due to her love of 
                    New York and its culture.[11]
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Spektor usually sings in English, though she sometimes 
                    includes a few words or verses of Latin, Russian, French, 
                    or other languages. She plays with pronunciations, 
                    which she told NPR was a remnant of her early years when 
                    she listened to pop in English without understanding the 
                    lyrics.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Her lyrics are equally eclectic, often taking the form of 
                    abstract narratives or first-person character studies, 
                    similar to short stories or vignettes put to song.[11][59] 
                    Some of Spektor's lyrics include literary allusions,[17] 
                    such as: F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway in 
                    "Poor Little Rich Boy"; The Little Prince in "Baobabs"; 
                    Virginia Woolf and Margaret Atwood in "Paris"; Ezra Pound 
                    and The Merchant of Venice in "Pound of Flesh"; Boris 
                    Pasternak in "Après Moi"; Samson and Delilah in "Samson"; 
                    Oedipus Rex in "Oedipus"; Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome in 
                    "2.99¢ Blues". Recurring themes and topics in Spektor's 
                    lyrics include love, death, religion (particularly 
                    biblical and Jewish references), city life (particularly 
                    New York references), and certain key phrases which recur 
                    in different songs, such as references to gravediggers, 
                    the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and the name 
                    "Mary Ann". Spektor's use of satire is evident in 
                    "Wasteside", which refers to The Twelve Chairs, the 
                    classic satirical novel by the Soviet authors Ilf and 
                    Petrov, and describes the town in which people are born, 
                    get their hair cut, and then are sent to the cemetery.

                    <br>
                    Spektor's first album, 11:11, was recorded and 
                    self-released while she was still in college. 
                    It differs from Spektor's later releases as she was 
                    heavily influenced by blues and jazz at the time of 
                    its recording. Her second album, Songs, was recorded 
                    on Christmas Day, 2001. Each song was recorded with 
                    just one take and is entirely acoustic. The session 
                    from which the album was derived was not originally 
                    intended as an album recording session.[60] Her third 
                    album, Soviet Kitsch, featured strings on several songs 
                    and was her first to feature a full rock band. Upon 
                    signing with a major label – which provided a bigger 
                    budget for production and studio time – Spektor began 
                    to emphasise production and more prominently use 
                    traditional pop and rock instruments.[14]
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Spektor says the records that most impact her are those 
                    of "bands whose music is really involved".[61] She cites 
                    the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Nirvana, Madonna, Eminem, Kate 
                    Bush, Rufus Wainwright, David Bowie, the Ramones, Patti 
                    Smith, Billie Holiday, Radiohead, Tom Waits, and Frédéric 
                    Chopin as prime influences.[61][62][63]

                    <br>
                    British singer Kate Nash said, "I related to her because 
                    she's a woman who plays the piano and writes imaginative 
                    songs. I've played the piano since I was about seven but 
                    I'd never seen it as an instrument for pop music. Regina 
                    Spektor made the piano cool… I love the fact that her 
                    accent shines through. When I started making music, 
                    it inspired me to sing the way I talk, because that's 
                    what's real."[64]
