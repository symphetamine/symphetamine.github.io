            imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what 
            language alone expresses. The design work can be based on a 
            customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established 
            linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic 
            design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.

            Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas 
            of knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For 
            example, it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it

            In this sense, in some countries graphic 
            design is related as only associated with the production of 
            sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual 
            communication is a small part of a huge range of types 
            and classes where it can be applied.

            Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange today, 
            the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, 
            particularly because of the development of new technologies and the 
            need to pay attention to human factors beyond the competence of 
            the engineers who develop them.

            ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic

            expression, and feeling to artifacts that document the human 
            experience."
