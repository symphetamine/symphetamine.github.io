                    Thanks for stopping by! I'm Sarah Symphetamine. A little 
                    about me: a Miami native that loves to travel and currently
                    resides in Gainesville, FL. I've lived in Los Angeles, 
                    Philadelphia, Canada, Peru & Costa Rica. I'm a well traveled
                    plus-sized queen, who loves all things music and art. I grew
                    up singing in choir and playing piano all throughout high
                    school. I also have my Associate in Science in Private
                    Investigation. I've worked in different fields of law 
                    (family, real estate, workers compensation and traffic). I 
                    also recently worked in dialysis, so when I say I'm a jack 
                    of all trades, I mean it. I am CPR certified, a notary and 
                    ordained. But really, my passion is all things music and art.
                    I decided to get into the field of graphic design so I can
                    make album covers for potential artists and work with 
                    musicians to help them achieve the art they want their fans
                    to see when they release new music. I am an avid vinyl 
                    collector - I have roughly 300 vinyls currently. My 
                    collection ranges, but I thoroughly enjoy finding first 
                    editions. Some of those are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Star Wars Episode Four Soundtrack</li>
                        <li>Queen - Jazz</li>
                        <li>The Beach Boys - Pet Sounds</li>
                        <li>The Beatles - Introducing...The Beatles</li>
                        <li>Fleetwood Mac - Rumors</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Hopefully, we can bond over music and creative ideas to have
                    your vision come to life in the form of a cover. I look
                    forward to working with you!
